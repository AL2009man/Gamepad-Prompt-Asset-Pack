# FAQ

For FAQ: most of the answers will reside within the Gamepad Asset Pack, however: there will be questions specific to this pack.

### Question 1: What's the purpose of this Asset Pack?

A: This version is intentionally designed to be similar to Steam Input API's built-in button prompts but with the same modularity principles as Gamepad Asset Pack.

### Question 2: Why is this pack separated from [Gamepad Asset Pack]?

This pack is intentionally designed to allow game developers/modders to utilize this pack, even commercially. In order to achieve this: 98% of the assets was recreated by scratch, while taking notes/inspiration from Steam Input's button prompts.

However, only 2% of it is reused from Gamepad Asset Pack, inorder to speed-up creation time. It might still be using licensed stuffs taken from it- but it'll be replaced in future versions


### Question 2: What does pack this include?

A: Nearly all platform-based button prompts.

As of this writing: variants of the Trackpad/Touchpad, platform-specific Home/Alt buttons and Paddle buttons have not made it in yet- but will come in a future update.



### Question 4: Which Image Editor, File Format and Fonts was used for this asset pack?

This asset pack was created using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/). 

All images formats are Inkscape SVG. For Image Editing: I recommend Inkscape for the best experience.

[Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) font family (by Steve Matteson) is used to display the lettered Symbols.

# Guideline

### Question 1: Can I use this Asset Pack for my personal or community-driven projects? (i.e Gamepad overlay, custom image, mods, reverse-engineered project, fan project)

As long as you credit this project (as per [MIT License](https://github.com/AL2009man/Gamepad-Overlay-Asset-Pack/blob/main/LICENSE)), sure.

### Question 2: Can I use this Asset Pack for my commercially released game/planned to be released commercially? (i.e: releasing on Steam, GOG, Epic Games Store, Microsoft/Xbox Store, PlayStation Store, etc.) 

98% of the assets can freely be used, certain assets like the DualSense's Mute Button and Nintendo Switch's Home Button might have to be replaced with an equivalent one, but these icons will be replaced in future versions.
